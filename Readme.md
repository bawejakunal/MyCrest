###WeShare: A Coercion-Resistant and Scalable Storage Cloud

MyCrest is a prototype developed for **WeShare: A Coercion-Resistant and Scalable Storage Cloud** over [Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com). The poster for WeShare can be accessed at [WeShare](http://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2015/posters/paper_8.pdf). This application is intended to demonstrate the concept of coercion resistant and scalable storage wherein a user can upload and share files over the cloud without having to rely on the service provider for the security of stored data along with the added advantage of low computational costs for sharing the encrypted files with users in comparison to the existing similar solutions.


####Working Description
MyCrest has been implemented as a browser extension for Google Chrome browser. The application runs on top of dropbox, which is used as the underlying cloud storage for encrypted files of the user and the files shared with other users. To use this developemental version of MyCrest please follow the following steps:
